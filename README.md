# Xencelabs Settings Files

![Xencelabs Driver Settings](https://download01.xencelabs.com/static/images/xencelabs/support/quick_start/xencelabs-partners-header.webp)

## Overview

This project contains a collection of settings files for the Xencelabs tablet product line. The idea is to use this repo to collect and share application settings for all the Xencelabs products and build a community to help share those settings as well as to ask questions.

Because of the nature of applications to have user defined hotkeys these settings files should be used as a starting point and customized from there.
